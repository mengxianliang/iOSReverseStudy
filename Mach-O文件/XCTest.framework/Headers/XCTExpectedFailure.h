 * @function XCTExpectFailure()
 * Declares that the test is expected to fail at some point beyond the call. This can be used to both document and
 * suppress a known issue when immediate resolution is not possible. Issues caught by XCTExpectFailure do not
 * impact the aggregate results of the test suites which own them.
 *
 * This function may be invoked repeatedly and has stack semantics. Failures are associated with the closest
 * matching expected failure and the stack is cleaned up by the test after it runs. If a failure is expected
 * but none is recorded, a distinct failure for the unmatched expected failure will be recorded instead.
 *
 * Threading considerations: when XCTExpectFailure is called on the test's primary thread it will match against
 * any issue recorded on any thread. When XCTExpectFailure is called on any other thread, it will only match
 * against issues recorded on the same thread.
 *
 * @param failureReason Explanation of the issue being suppressed. If it contains
 * a URL, that URL can be extracted and presented as a link in reporting UI (Xcode and CI).
